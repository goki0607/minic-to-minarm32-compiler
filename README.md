# MinC to MinArm32 Compiler Project

This is the public repository for my (Goktug Saatcioglu) MinC to MinArm32 Compiler Project. Each project milestone is under the relevant relevant folders (pr1, pr2 and pr3). To compile and run the compiler you will need Ubuntu along with the latest version of Hacs. The public repo for Hacs is [here](https://github.com/crsx/hacs). Please see each of the pdfs in the project folders to see detailed descriptions of each part.
